<h2>20 things that will make you more productive than ever</h2>
<span class="author">by darius foroux</span>
<p class="line">The last year has been huge for me. I’ve got more things done than ever, switched careers and countries, spent loads of time with my family and friends, kept a healthy lifestyle, and exercised at least 5 times a week.</p>

<p>Many variables determine your overall productivity. Tools, apps, or hacks, don’t work if you lack the right mindset because productivity is a way of living.</p>

<p>It’s about achieving maximum output, getting shit done, and not wasting time. I think that output and happiness go hand in hand. To me, doing nothing equals misery.</p>

<p>I want to share 20 things I’ve done in the past 12 months that have made me more productive than ever.</p>
<ol>
<li><h4>Always Cut To The Chase</h4>
<p>With everything in life, there’s a bunch of crap, and there’s stuff that matters. Chit chat, small talk, delaying, waiting around, not speaking up, is all useless. If you want to get shit done, you have to jump straight into the action.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Record All Your Thoughts And Ideas</h4>
<p>Similar to computers, we have a Random Access Memory (RAM). Your human RAM stores relevant short-term information. But your RAM capacity is limited. When it’s full, older information that you have stored will be deleted to make room for new information. You want to write down your thoughts to unload your RAM, which gives you more brainpower. Even if you never take a look at that note again, it’s still worth it.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Say No</h4>
<p>When it comes to work, I say no to everything that doesn’t support my goals and values. We live in an abundant world — there are always enough opportunities. In my personal life, I say no to everything that doesn’t thrill me. When I think ‘meh’ about something, I always say NO. That eliminates wasting time on shit that I’m not excited about.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Take A 5 Minute Break Every 30 To 45 Minutes</h4>
<p>You can stretch your back, walk around, drink some water. But more importantly, you take your nose out of your work. When you come back to your desk, you might have new ideas. Or, you might think: “WHAT THE FUCK AM I DOING?” And stop it before you waste all your time.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Eliminate Everything That Distracts You</h4>
<p>Willpower is overrated. If something distracts you, eliminate it. One of my friends has a news addiction. I suggested to get rid of his tv, delete his news apps, and block the news sites on his laptop. Two weeks later he told me that he’s finally starting a business. Don’t think you’re immune to your distractions. Remove them.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Keep Away Clutter</h4>
<p>A cluttered life means a cluttered brain. And with a cluttered brain, you can’t get stuff done. I prefer a simple work and living environment. A desk, a laptop, and a notebook. Keep it simple. You don’t need any fluff.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Focus On 1 Thing Some Days</h4>
<p>If you have recurring tasks, try to do as much of the same thing on one day. I write 2–3 blog posts on 1 day, the other days of the week I use for my other projects and businesses. On my writing days I turn off my phone, and just write. Nothing else gets in the way.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Stop Consuming So Much Information</h4>
<p>You don’t need to read 5000 articles on productivity. If you find useful information, try it. Don’t search for more. More is not always better. You can only process so much of it. Stop consuming, start creating.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Create Routines</h4>
<p>Decisions fatigue your brain. And routines eliminate decisions. Which ultimately means more brainpower. Routines are not OCD — they are efficient. Use them.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Don’t Multitask</h4>
<p>When you juggle multiple things simultaneously, like; sending an email, texting a friend and checking your Facebook while you are in a meeting, you engage in context switching. In a research done by Gloria Mark of the University of California, Irvine, it showed that it takes an average of 25 minutes to return to the original task after an interruption. That’s a waste of useful time.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Check Email Twice A Day</h4>
<p>Every time you check your email, you get a rush of dopamine. I get it — checking email feels nice, and most of us are addicted. While dopamine may cause a rush, it also exhausts you. That is why you still feel tired at the end of the day while you have not been productive. To minimize that, turn off notifications, and check your email only twice a day on set times.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>No Smartphone During The First Hour Of Your Day</h4>
<p>A smartphone’s primary function is to interrupt you. But don’t let other people or apps interrupt you during the first hour of your day. Take that first hour to think about the day ahead of you, read a book, enjoy your breakfast, coffee or tea.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Plan The Next Day </h4>
<p>Every night before I go to bed, I take 5 minutes to set my priorities (usually 3–4) for the next day. That makes me more focused when I wake up. I find that I waste time if I don’t do this practice. It’s cool to ‘go with the flow’. The only problem is: I don’t want to be a dog that mindlessly chases cars.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Keep ‘Thinking’ To A Minimum</h4>
<p>When people say: “I’m thinking.” They mean worrying by thinking. Don’t think too much. Just DO, and see what happens. If you like what you’re seeing, continue. If not, do something else.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Exercise </h4>
<p>A few things are vital in life: Food, water, shelter, relationships, and exercise. Without this stuff you can’t function properly. Scientific research shows that regular exercise can make you happier, smarter, and more energetic.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Laugh A Little</h4>
<p>Laughing reduces stress. And if you want to keep up your productivity, you don’t want stress. So move the corners of your mouth upward as much as you can.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Don’t Go To Meetings</h4>
<p>This is a tough one for people who work for corporations. Some companies have a ‘Meeting’ culture. People organize meetings just to look important or procrastinate real work. For goodness sake, PLEASE STOP.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Is That Really Necessary?</h4>
<p>Ask yourself that question as often as you can. You will find that your answer is often: Nope. So why do unnecessary things?</p>
</li>
<li><h4>If You’re Having A Shitty Day, Press Reset</h4>
<p>You might screw, maybe someone gets angry with you—shit happens. Don’t get down about it. Take some time alone, meditate, listen to music, or go for a walk. Try to get back on track — don’t let your day go to waste.</p>
</li>
<li><h4>Do The Work</h4>
<p>Yes, talking about work is easier than doing it. Everyone can do it. But you’re not everyone, right? You’re a productivity beast. So act like one.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Without these 20 things, I wouldn’t be productive at all. You may have noticed that I don’t get into details, like which tools and apps I use.</p>

<p>I don’t think that stuff matters. It’s about creating a productivity mindset and environment that lets you thrive.</p>

<p>I only care about getting things done in a fun and not stressful way. That makes doing work way more fun and rewarding.</p>

<h2>the ultimate productivity hack is saying no</h2>
<span class="author">by James Clear</span>
<p class="line">The ultimate productivity hack is saying no.</p>

<p>Not doing something will always be faster than doing it. As I heard one computer programmer say, “Remember that there is no code faster than no code.” </p>

<p>The same applies in many areas of life. There is no meeting that goes faster than not having a meeting at all. This is not to say you should never attend another meeting, but the truth is that we say yes to many things we don't actually want to do. There are many meetings held that don't need to be held. There is a lot of code written that could be deleted. In work and personal life, there is a lot of wasted time and energy.

<h3>The Default Reply</h3>
<p class="line">When an opportunity arises, saying yes seems to be the default reply. Sometimes this is out of social custom, sometimes out of habit, sometimes due to a lack of clear priorities.</p>

<p>To a certain degree, we appear wired to say yes. For most of human history, our ancestors lived in a world where opportunities were scarce. The human mind had to say yes to each opportunity to find food and water, seek shelter, and secure safety, or it wouldn't survive.</p>

<p>But the modern world is one of abundance, not scarcity. Most of us have more calories, more choices, and more information than we know what to do with. Despite the fact that we could pick and choose activities more carefully than ever before, we still seem to jump at any opportunity as if it would be hard to find something to do with our time. As the author Nassim Taleb has noted, “Abundance is harder for us to handle than scarcity.”</p>

<p>Whether out of evolutionary wiring or simple habit, nobody seems to question things. How often do people ask you to do something and you just reply, “Sure thing.” Three days later you're overwhelmed by how much is on your to-do list. We become frustrated by our obligations even though we were the ones who said yes to them in the first place.</p>

<p>We are particularly bad at saying no to what we have already started. Saying no to the rest of a bad movie. Quitting a terrible book. Stopping a project that no longer serves you. We seem adamant about finishing a task once it has been opened.</p>

<p>Even worse, people will occasionally fight to do things that waste time. “Why can't you just come to the meeting? We have it every week.” Just because it's scheduled weekly doesn't mean it's necessary weekly.</p>

<p>It's worth asking if things are necessary because many of them are not and a simple “no” will be more productive than whatever work the most efficient person can muster. I am reminded of the famous Peter Drucker quote, “There is nothing so useless as doing efficiently that which should not be done at all.”</p>

<h3>The Difference Between Yes and No</h3>
<p class="line">The words “yes” and “no” get used in comparison to each other so often that it feels like they carry equal weight in conversation. In reality, they are not just opposite in meaning, but of entirely different magnitudes in commitment.</p>

<p>When you say no, you are only saying no to one option. When you say yes, you are saying no to every other option. Once you have committed to something, you have already decided how that future hour will be spent.</y>

<p>Saying no gains you time in the future. Saying yes costs you time in the future. No is a form of time credit. You retain the ability to spend your time however you want. Yes is a form of time debt. You have to pay it back at some point.</p>

<p>In short: No is a decision. Yes is a responsibility.</p>

<h3>Earning the Right to Say No</h3>
<p class="line">In most fields, you have to go through a period where you say yes to nearly every opportunity before you can earn the right to say no to nearly every opportunity.

<p>Learning to make this switch is hard.</p>

<p>But saying no isn't a privilege reserved for the successful among us. It's a practice that can actually help you become successful. Even in the beginning, you need to learn to say no to whatever isn't leading you toward your goals. Most of the time we refer to this by another name: staying focused.</p>

<p>The people who do valuable work often have a remarkable willingness to say no to distractions and focus on one thing. Nobody embodied this idea better than Steve Jobs, who said, “People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully.” </p>

<p>If you lack the ability to say no to distractions then achieving something meaningful is an uphill battle. As one reader told me, “If you broaden the definition as to how you apply “no”, it actually is the only productivity hack (as you ultimately say no to any distraction in order to be productive).” </p>

<h3>Getting Better at Saying No</h3>
<p class="line">Saying no is useful at any time, but generally it becomes more important as you grow older. You have less time left and you're more clear about what matters to you, so you should be saying no to more things and doing what you enjoy most.</p>

<p>In the beginning, you have to say yes more frequently so you can discover what works and what you enjoy. You have to try things out. As you experiment, you come to learn what you enjoy and what actions get the results you're looking for.</p>

<p>Once you know what matters, you should increasingly say no to anything that doesn't.</p>

<h3>How to Say No</h3>
<p class="line">Learning to say no is a powerful skill because it retains the most important asset in life: your time.</p>

<p>Learning to say no doesn't mean you'll never say yes. It just means no is the default. By saying no to almost everything, you can say yes to the things that matter most to you. You say no to most things life tosses your way so you can say yes to your kids or watching Netflix or whatever it is that you actually want to do with your time. Each experience has to justify becoming a yes. You don't have to agree to something just because it exists.</p>

<p>What you say no to will shape your day, your career, your family, and your life.</p>

<p>Say no, more. Say yes, carefully.</p>
